 Cognitive Core v2.0 – Hallucination Management Layer

Extension Module for FWS (Flexible Workflow System)

This repository provides an advanced three‑layer hallucination‑management and cognitive‑safety module designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing FWS architecture.

It introduces a structured pipeline for analyzing model outputs, detecting gray‑zone risks, and producing actionable decisions (allow, rewrite, human_review) that can be consumed by FWS workflows.

 Purpose

FWS focuses on flexible workflow orchestration.  
This module extends it by adding:

- Context‑aware input analysis  
- Gray‑zone detection for ambiguous or risky outputs  
- A decision engine that quantifies hallucination and safety risk  
- A Streamlit UI for debugging and visualization  

This makes it ideal for:
- LLM safety research  
- Model evaluation  
- Workflow gating  
- Human‑in‑the‑loop moderation

 Architecture

Layer 1 – Context Detection
Extracts:
- Mood  
- Cultural pattern  
- Tone  
- Emotional intensity  
- Sensitivity level  

Uses lightweight regex heuristics for fast evaluation.

---

Layer 2 – Gray‑Zone Detection
Analyzes the model output for:
- Ambiguity  
- Insult probability  
- Humor vs. insult  
- Critique vs. attack  

Produces a grayzone_score.

---

Layer 3 – Decision Engine
Combines:
- Hallucination score  
- Risk score  
- Context mismatch  
- Reality alignment  

Outputs:
- allow
- rewrite
- human_review

This output can be consumed directly by FWS as a gating node.
